## Solution for Project Proposal 
We want to create, what we are calling, The Smart Plant Pot. Our solution is based on the technique of hydroponics. We will be eliminating the meticulous caretaking that growing plants normally necessitates, that is, our solution will require little to no human intervention. Our solution will monitor the temperature, humidity, light, and water levels concerning the plant and ensure that it is within the necessary range for a particular plant type. We will have a TFT LCD and an easy-to-use rotary encoder displaying hydroponic plant options that the user can easily peruse and pick from. 

We will have a humidity control system with adjustable vents, a fan for careful air circulation to maintain the humidity levels necessary for the plant. Our device will automatically calibrate the settings based on the plant type and the humidity sensor that will be monitoring real-time data. We will also have a temperature system closely monitoring the temperature of the water along with a water-level sensor to track our Smart Plant Pot’s water reservoirs, which will be filled/drained depending on when it is due for either. For the lights, we will be using grow lights, considering our solution focuses on houseplants. These grow lights and our device’s adjustable shades will be tuned according to the data from the light sensor in concert with how much light a plant needs. All of the plant stats will be recorded and displayed on the TFT LCD for the user. We will also have a maintenance alert system in the case that manual intervention becomes necessary, but our sensors and our in-built automatic systems will be used to surveil the plants/plant-growth at all times. 

## Max Rating for Grow Light Subsystem
- LTR-329 light sensor: supply voltage range (2.4V-3.6V)
- 1528-1367-ND stepper motor: 12V 
- Which grow light? – 5V?? <br/>
