# Reliability Testing/Humidity and Temp Sensor Debugging

At this point, all that was left of the project was to ensure reliability. This meeting was not as productive as we would've liked. We worked really hard, but the outcome still remained mostly unreliable in terms of real-time data. At this point, we had to wait for some new sensors to come in. During one of our meetings, the humidity and temperature sensor did not work and Gavin and Morgan assumed it was because they had fried the chip. I decided to debug using an arduino and was able to get some readings, however, since this sensor was practically on life-support, it occassionally froze up/died or read values in the negatives.
