# Design Review Prep Meeting 
In this meeting, we discussed everything we'd be covering in the design review. Since I wrote the introduction and solution along with the three subsystems: oxygenation, humidity, and lights, I practiced these with the group. I also wrote the labor costs and schedule, which I also practiced and covered at the design review. During the review, I mainly went over the requirements & verification for the subsystems I wrote about. <br/>

## Introduction & Solution 
Growing indoor plants can help with the environment as well as provide a method to grow food quickly and sustainably. However, without the proper knowledge base and constant attention, plants can quickly die or become a burden to take care of. Our solution will use automated hydroponics. This is a water-based, environment-controlled technique [7]. Traditional, outdoor farming techniques require constant intervention for prolonged periods of time depending on the weather/soil conditions. This puts the weight of careful, hands-on plant care on the individual, whereas our system will not. Hydroponic plants can grow up to 25% faster, and our design takes advantage of this [29]. By using a controlled environment, i.e., with an automatic light, humidity, and temperature subsystem, our solution aims to remove the need for constant manual intervention and will allow for any individual to grow plants (with or without expertise). By removing the variability in the environment, it will be easier to take care of plants and keep track of everything the plant needs. However, there are new challenges posed with a hydroponics technique. These include taking care of the water reservoir temperature, root aeration, and water top off and purging. Without our system, these issues would require constant manual labor maintenance, but these processes can now be safely automated considering the controlled environmental conditions. Our solution will provide this controlled environment and automation based on different stimuli. While this is a small-scale solution meant for use at home, this is a proof of concept for expansion into general-purpose agriculture. 

We want to create, what we are calling, The Smart Plant Pot. Our solution is based on the technique of hydroponics. We will be eliminating the meticulous caretaking that growing plants normally necessitates, such that little to no human intervention is needed. Our solution will monitor the temperature, humidity, light, and water levels concerning the plant and ensure that it is within the necessary range for a particular type. We will have a TFT LCD and an easy-to-use rotary encoder displaying hydroponic plant options that the user can easily peruse and pick from. 

We will have a humidity control system with adjustable vents and a fan for careful air circulation to maintain the humidity levels necessary for the plant. Our device will automatically calibrate the settings based on the plant type and the humidity sensor that will be monitoring real-time data. We will also have a temperature system closely monitoring the temperature of the water along with a water-level sensor to track our Smart Plant Pot’s water reservoirs, which will be filled/drained depending on when it is due for either. For the lights, we will be using grow lights, considering our solution focuses on houseplants. These grow lights and our device’s adjustable shades will be tuned according to the data from the light sensor in concert with how much light a plant needs. All of the plant data will be recorded and displayed on the TFT LCD for the user. Lastly, we will also have a maintenance alert system in the case that manual intervention becomes necessary, but our sensors and our built-in automatic systems will be used to survey the plants/plant-growth at all times.
