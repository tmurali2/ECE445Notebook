# Labor Costs 
Upon graduation, the average cost of what a University of Illinois Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate makes is $88,321/year for Electrical Engineering [20] and $118,752/year for Computer Engineering [8]. In a year, there are 52 weeks/weekends, amounting to 52*2  = 104 non-business days. This results in 365-104 = 261 working days in a year. $88,321/261 days = $338.39/day for EE and $118,752/261 days = $455/day. An average working day is 8 hours/day. For EE, this amounts to $42.30/hour (338.39/8). For CE, this amounts to 455/8 = $56.88/hour. We estimate this project will take, on average, 10 hours/week for 7 weeks (starting the week of Oct 7th and ending the week of Nov 18th). A reasonable salary/labor costs for each team member would be about $42.30/hour * 2.5 * 70 hours or $56.88/hour * 2.5 * 70 hours, amounting in a total of $7402.50 for EE or $9954 for CE per team member. To provide an average cost, letâ€™s say the labor costs per team member is the average of the CE and EE costs, i.e., ($7402.50+$9954)/2 = $8678.25. For 3 team members, this is $8678.25*3 = $26,034.75 in labor costs.
