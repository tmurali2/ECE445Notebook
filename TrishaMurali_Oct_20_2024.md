# More STM32 Updates (Problems/Debugging)
This day, unfortunately was not as productive as I'd hoped. My STM32CubeIDE ended up having some issues and I had to save all my code and configured clock settings and I had to delete and reinstall the IDE due to some missing packages. Eventually, in order to test that signals were being sent, I spent the day getting the LEDs to blink again. To do this, I just followed some basic tutorial code to avoid spending too much time on it. I was able to get the LED blinking, but this issue ended up taking up the entire time I had blocked for ECE 445 on that day since I suspected that it was because of the servo or stepper at first.
