Here, we made a video and practiced for our mock presentation. We also changed up our slides and practiced for our actual presentation. As for the mock presentation, we ended up presenting pretty well and received good feedback. During this presentation, I presented the premise and UI slides as well as the future work and ethical concerns. We just ensured that we were mostly within the time frame for the project. These entries are relatively shorter as the result of the project coming to an end. During the final presentation, I presented the premise, UI, and the sensors since I knew a lot about the firmware portions of the project as well as the I2C communication. I also presented our actuators for each subsystem and presented our future work and ethical concerns here as well.
