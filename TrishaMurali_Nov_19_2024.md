At this point, we were preparing for the mock demo. At this point, our temperature sensors were unreliable and our wires were not cleaned up. Along with this, our setup took 30 minutes since we had to wire everything into our PCBs. We also had to implement RTC (real time clock) for our display since the idea of the plant pot is that it will, in ideal conditions, be able to sustain a plant for 9 weeks. This, however, made things very difficult since the RTC would freeze up on us at times and our data would not update or some of the sensors/actuators would shut off and not be able to show the functionality even if it normally did. This is something we had to fix. As a result, we got new sensors and used those, but for the mock demo, we were in good shape overall since the majority of the project was done and integrated. Integration was slightly difficult since for the mock demo, we still wanted to use the dev board for the signals just to be safe and for easier transference. This was mainly because all of us contributed to separate parts of the project. We had a meeting to transfer everything over to Gavin's STM32 dev board. This is the one we use for our mock demo. We did have the PCB implementation at this point with the STM soldered on. We were also able to read a high signal. 

Also, we were able to test the light sensor, which responded to a flashlight.
