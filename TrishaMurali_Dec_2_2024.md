# Demo Prep 
We now have reliable data and connections with good wire management. We're prepping for our demo and here we're just mostly testing some final things and creating the guide for the presentation. We practice for a few hours on who is going to present each portion and we run through it with the rubric in mind. I started off the presentation and showed the LCD portions with the different screens. In this time, I set the plant type to be "demo plant" which has lower threshold than our other plants for demonstration purposes. For instance, the grow light was set to shut off at 6 minutes (in normal conditions this would be between 6-16 hours) and the water changes occurred at the 3 minute mark (ideally this would be every 3 weeks). I also presented the grow lights portion of the the project and demonstrated the light sensor. Along with this I also showed the notification we later added to indicate when the water is too cold or hot. This is to warn the users that a water change will not occur as a result of that. This is to ensure that it stays within the threshold for plants (i.e., not too harmful). I also ran through the statistics and showed that all our real-time data was updating within 1 second. Here is the guide that we printed and stapled up together (total of 10 pages with our high level requirements and R&V tables as a result of our many PCBs and sensors). In addition to this, since I had performed the most statistical research into hydroponics and thresholds, I also explained the objective and purpose of our project.

I printed all of this in color (I spent $35 at the library doing this :()
