### Post 1 <br/>
Hi everyone, <br/> 
My name is Trisha Murali and my group would like to focus on home automation systems/devices. One of my ideas for this project was to make pet care accessible and convenient. An automatic pet feeder! There are quite a few options available on the market, but as a dog mom myself, it’s been difficult to find one with all the features I’d like for my Golden Retriever to have. I’ve detailed my idea below.<br/> 
<br/> 
Problem: While we’d like to provide our pets with the best care possible and be by their side every second, it isn’t always feasible. Life gets in the way – sometimes we have to go to work, sometimes we have to travel, and sometimes we’re just not feeling very well. This automatic pet feeder can help! There are quite a few options available on the market, but it isn’t easy to find one with all the features we’d like. Some of the available pet feeders require manual cleaning and usually only come in with a single dispenser and bowl. This is especially unhelpful when you’re at work and/or on travel and you’d like to be able to refill your pet’s bowl with food/water and give them a treat! Your cat or dog may also have preferred options of wet foods, in which case, it necessitates multiple bowls and regular cleaning. It could also be the case that your pet may lose their appetite from eating the same foods the whole week (happens with my dog!) or they may develop an irregular eating schedule if the food is just left out for a long time (again, happens with my dog!). <br/> 
<br/> 
Solution: In order to deal with this problem, I suggest we have multiple dispensers with water and different foods. Depending on the time of day/decided schedule, our PCB design will allow for the feeder to dispense the appropriate food and we can use sensors to detect the water level. If it’s empty, it can be refilled. Similarly, we can use sensors to detect if the food dispenser is low on supply and it can notify your phone. After each meal, it will automatically clean and dry the bowls or dispose of the bowls. In addition to this, we will also allow for communication with a device to be able to override or make any changes when you’re away or if you’d just like to be able to give your pet an extra treat! <br/>

### Post 2 <br/>
Hi again, <br/> 
My name is Trisha Murali and as I mentioned in my previous post, my group and I are interested in home automation systems and devices. My other idea for this project is an eco-friendly temperature control system with an automatic lighting system.<br/>  
Problem: Oftentimes, we are met with the challenge of having to put the blinds up/down and having to adjust the settings on our thermostat. We use lights in the daytime when we can make good use of some sunlight and we use the thermostat when we’re not in need of it. Automating this can make the process accessible and energy efficient.<br/> 
<br/> 
Solution: Depending on the time of day and the position of the sun, our eco-friendly temperature control system will automatically let the blinds down and turn on the lights. Similarly, when it’s daytime, it will automatically roll up the blinds and turn the lights off. This will also be based on the temperature sensors we place on the device. We will also have communication to the thermostat to increase or decrease the temperature based on pre-set preferences and detected temperature. <br/>
