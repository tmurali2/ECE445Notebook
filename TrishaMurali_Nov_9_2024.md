# LCD Debugging on Arduino
The TFT LCD did not work yesterday, so in order to debug and make sure that this issue was not just caused by my unfamiliarity with the STM32, I used an arduino. This also simplified the process considering that the arduino has a simpler, more usable library along with more tutorials/resources online. 

After using the arduino, I was able to get the LCD to display something, which eliminated some of the doubts I had earlier such as having messed up the soldering and/or the LCD not working.
