The TFT LCD did not work yesterday, so in order to debug and make sure that this issue was not just caused by my unfamiliarity with the STM32, I used an arduino. This also simplified the process considering that the arduino has a simpler, more usable library along with more tutorials/resources online. 

After using the arduino, I was able to get the LCD to display something, which eliminated some of the doubts I had earlier such as having messed up the soldering and/or the LCD not working.
