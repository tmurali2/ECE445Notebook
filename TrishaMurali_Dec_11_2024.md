We completed our final paper and submitted it. As for the final paper, I wrote up the introduction and cost/labor parts. I also added in figure captions and edited the rest of the document to fit with that. Since our design document was very thorough (50 pages) including testing, we had no problems writing our final paper. Completing our project ahead of time served us well. Below are a few my contributions to the final paper:
